# Manual Deployment Steps

Since terminal commands are hanging, here's how to deploy manually:

## Step 1: Upload to GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/yarrickau/Pinpropertypro.com
2. Click "Add file" > "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop ALL files from the `pin-property-fresh` folder
4. Commit with message: "Fresh website with stable dependencies"

## Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click "New Project" 
3. Select your `Pinpropertypro.com` repository
4. Framework Preset: Vite
5. Root Directory: leave as `.` (root)
6. Build Command: `npm run build`
7. Output Directory: `dist`
8. Install Command: `npm install`
9. Click "Deploy"

## Files to Upload:
- index.html
- package.json  
- vite.config.js
- tailwind.config.js
- postcss.config.js
- vercel.json
- src/ (entire folder with all contents)

The website should deploy successfully with these stable dependencies.
